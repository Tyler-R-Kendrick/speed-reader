# GitHub Copilot Usage

This project prefers clean, idiomatic TypeScript. When using Copilot suggestions:

- Prioritize readable code with descriptive names and comments.
- Favour Lit patterns and functional helpers from existing modules.
- Ensure any generated markup includes proper ARIA labels and works on mobile screens.
- Add or update tests alongside any feature code.
- Run `npm run lint` and `npm test` to verify before committing.
