# Decision: Expand WPM Range

We reduced the minimum playback speed from 200 to 100 words per minute and increased
the maximum from 350 to 800 wpm. This change supports users who require a slower
starting point and those who wish to experiment with much faster speeds.

Although studies show comprehension drops above 300 wpm, the wider range allows
advanced readers and researchers to evaluate extreme speeds while keeping the
default at 300 wpm.
