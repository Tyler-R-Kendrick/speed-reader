# Decision: Add Touch Gestures and Progress Bar

We introduced swipe and tap gestures to make the RSVP player usable on mobile screens without relying on keyboard shortcuts. Swiping left rewinds five words, swiping right fastâ€‘forwards five words, and tapping near the left or right edges decreases or increases speed. A center tap toggles play and pause.

A visual progress bar was also added so readers can see and scrub through their place in the text. Clicking or tapping the bar jumps to the selected word.

These changes improve usability on touch devices while keeping keyboard controls intact.
